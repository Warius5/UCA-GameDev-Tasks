## Planning

I decided to use trello to set up the plans. I set up different sections for each week sprint, and set up a checklist for each developer.
Next i need to look at the tasks and break down the different requirements into tasks and figure out who does what.



### Core Gameplay:
1. Maths Exercise 
    - Choice of exercise menu; +, -, x, /
    - Generating and showcasing questions
    - Answer Checking
    - Increasing difficulty




### Progression System:
1. Progress tracking
    - Level completion amount
    - Scores for students excersizes
    - Show areas done well / done badly

### Dialogue System
1. Dialogue boxes
    - Pop up instruction boxes
    - Feedback messages


### Localization
1. Translations of text for different languages
    - Support for English
    - Spanish
    - Korean



### User Interface
1. Menus 
    - Clear and easy to navigate for primary school students. 
    - Making it cross platform usable
2. Buttons
    - Distinct, understandable buttons
3. Colours and readability
    - Make sure accessible ( Colour blindness )
    - Nice looking style
4. Positioning
    - Easy use and easy viewing of buttons and other element.
5. Displaying questions
    - Clear and big enough to see easily, good font.
    - 

### Rewards System 
- Creating badges
- Asigning point values for rewards to exercises 
- Pop ups and overview of rewards


### Sound Effects and Animations
- Sounds on pressing buttons
- Sounds for wrong and right answer
- Animations for questions popping up


With the tasks figured out for each sections, then assigning when they should be done and other tasks like testing.
Ive set out the trello board into sprints with a section for each developer. So that a developer could go to their section in the week it is, and figure out what their tasks were.
There were some design tasks that would need to be done, so i assigned that work to whoever didnt have anything to do that week.

## Reflection

The practise on creating a plan for a project using sprints was useful to see how extensive planning can make it easier for someone to complete a task.
<br>
In the future i will probably research the best way to layout a trello board for this type of task, as the way i have done it, is probably not the most straightforward to use.
<br>
Perhaps more details on the task could be good as well but its hard to think of all the different parts without sitting and figuring it out with the client.
