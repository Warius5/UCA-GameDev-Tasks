## Methodology Research

### Agile
#### Overview
Agile methodology is one based around adptiveness and response to change. The tasks are broken down into sprints that last 1-4 weeks. A focus is also put onto collaboration between teams, and between the clients for better understanding.
Constant feedback and iteration is a main tenent of the methodology.
(What is Agile? | Agile 101 | Agile Alliance, 2015)
#### Pro's
- Flexibility
- Customer Focus
- High Quality 
#### Con's
- Requires high communication
- May not be suitable for rigid, fixed timelines


### Waterfall
#### Overview
Waterfall is a traditional, linear project management, where the work goes through phases in sequential order.
There are no overlapping phases, and when one phase is done its generally doesn't go back to previous ones without probably going back to the start.
The project is planned out, leaving minimal room for changes.
The teams on the project then work on the phases sequentially.
And then its delivered at the end, with maintenance if required afterward. (Waterfall Methodology for Project Management | Atlassian, s.d.)
#### Pro's
- Clear Structure and linear proccess
- Detailed requirements and design mean good understanding of project from beginning 
- Easey to manage with clear milestones

#### Con's
- Changes are hard to accomodate after the beginning 
- Errors only really found during the testing phase, causing larger problems
- Higher risk of misalignment or disapointment as client doesn't' see product till end.

### Kanban
#### Overview
Kanban is a visual methodology, focusing on flow and transparency. The tasks are represented on a kanban board to show a share workflow. This allows the ability to monitor and improve the tasks to increase efficiency. (Kanban, s.d.)

#### Pro's
- Highly Flexibly and updateable 
- Team visibiltiy helps avoid confusion
- Limited setup
#### Con's
- Requires higher discipline and maintenance of the board
- Provides less structure so less experienced people may struggle
- strict deadlines may cause issues.


## Planning

I decided to use trello to set up the plans. I set up different sections for each week sprint, and set up a checklist for each developer. I think as the requirements are quite set i will use it to create more of a waterfall approach, but with the added visibility from it being a board, so the other team members can see what they can do. Therefore any collaboration or timing is easy to see.
Next i need to look at the tasks and break down the different requirements into tasks and figure out who does what.


### Core Gameplay:
1. Maths Exercise 
    - Choice of exercise menu; +, -, x, /
    - Generating and showcasing questions
    - Answer Checking
    - Increasing difficulty




### Progression System:
1. Progress tracking
    - Level completion amount
    - Scores for students excersizes
    - Show areas done well / done badly

### Dialogue System
1. Dialogue boxes
    - Pop up instruction boxes
    - Feedback messages


### Localization
1. Translations of text for different languages
    - Support for English
    - Spanish
    - Korean



### User Interface
1. Menus 
    - Clear and easy to navigate for primary school students. 
    - Making it cross platform usable
2. Buttons
    - Distinct, understandable buttons
3. Colours and readability
    - Make sure accessible ( Colour blindness )
    - Nice looking style
4. Positioning
    - Easy use and easy viewing of buttons and other element.
5. Displaying questions
    - Clear and big enough to see easily, good font.
    - 

### Rewards System 
- Creating badges
- Asigning point values for rewards to exercises 
- Pop ups and overview of rewards


### Sound Effects and Animations
- Sounds on pressing buttons
- Sounds for wrong and right answer
- Animations for questions popping up



With the tasks figured out for each sections, then assigning when they should be done and other tasks like testing.
Ive set out the trello board into sprints with a section for each developer. So that a developer could go to their section in the week it is, and figure out what their tasks were.
There were some design tasks that would need to be done, so i assigned that work to whoever didnt have anything to do that week.

## Reflection

The practise on creating a plan for a project using sprints was useful to see how extensive planning can make it easier for someone to complete a task.
<br>
In the future i will probably research the best way to layout a trello board for this type of task, as the way i have done it, is probably not the most straightforward to use.
<br>
Perhaps more details on the task could be good as well but its hard to think of all the different parts without sitting and figuring it out with the client.
